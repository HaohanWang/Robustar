![workflow](readme_support/RobustarFunction.png "workflow")

1.	the model can be trained elsewhere and then fed into the software; 
2.	With new test samples, the model can help identify the samples that are responsible for the prediction through influence function; 
3.	the software offers saliency map to help the user know which part of the features the model are paying necessary attention; 
4.	the users can use the drawing tools to brush out the superficial pixels; 
5.	new annotation of these images will serve as the role as augmented images for continued training.
